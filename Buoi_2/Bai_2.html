<h1>Low and Slow</h1>
<p>
  This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In sous vide cooking, you submerde the food(usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a wter bath thar is aprecisele set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <em>Cooking fir Geeks</em>, Jeff Potter describes ir as "ultra-low temperature poaching".
</p>
  Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a seat ar the chef table, contact us before November 30.
